ALOHA! This is Tianxin.

I am now a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in [Wireless Network and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), [The University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). My supervisor is [Xudong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oG2PlTsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am fortunate to receive the full scholarship of [Zhiyuan Honors Doctorate Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en/about/overview). Before joining SJTU, I obtained my bachelor's degree from School of Information Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) in 2020.

From August 2023 to February 2025, I will be visiting [Intelligent Transmission and Processing Lab (ITP)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/intelligent-transmission-and-processing-laboratory) in Imperial College London, supervised by [Geoffrey Y. Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d0FzG8YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of wireless networks and machine learning.

I am now a Ph.D candidate in Institute for [Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am very fortunate to have [Prof. Mingyu Gao](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~gaomy/) as my advisor. Before joining Tsinghua, I obtained a bachelor's degree from [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) in 2020. I studied at [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/main.psp), Southeast University from Aug 2016 to September 2017 as I was a freshman. My research interests mainly lie in systems security, especially, the trusted execution environment (TEE), including its applications, side channels, formal models, and combination with cryptography.

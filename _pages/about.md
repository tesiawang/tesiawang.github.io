I am now a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in [Wireless Network and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), with the full scholarship of [Zhiyuan Honors Doctorate Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en/about/overview) (top 10% Ph.D. students). Our lab belongs to [The University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Currently, I am a Ph.D. visiting student in [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) starting from August, 2023. I am fortunate to be co-supervised by [Xudong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oG2PlTsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and [Geoffrey Y. Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d0FzG8YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from Imperial College London. Before joining SJTU, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [School of Information Science and Engineering](https://radio.seu.edu.cn/newenglish/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm) in 2020. My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of wireless networks and artificial intelligence.

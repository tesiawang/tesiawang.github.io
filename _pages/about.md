**Aloha, this is Tianxin Wang (王天欣).**

I am a final-year Ph.D candidate in [Wireless Network and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://wanglab.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Default.aspx), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Xudong Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oG2PlTsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from SJTU and Prof. [Geoffrey Ye Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d0FzG8YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from Imperial College London. During PhD, it is my honor to receive full scholarship of [SJTU Zhiyuan Honors Doctorate Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en/about/overview). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University in 2020.

My PhD research is mainly focused on two parts: 1) AI-assisted network resource and topology planning; 2) AI-assisted wireless receivers. I am strongly interested in different layers of data networks, from network layer, MAC layer, to physical layer.
